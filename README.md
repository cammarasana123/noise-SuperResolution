# noise-SuperResolution

We propose our networks for the super-resolution of noisy 2D images, affected by 2X/4X Gaussian noise and 2X speckle noise.

2X networks read a 128 X 128 image and generate the up-sampled 256 X 256 image;
4X network reads a 64 X 64 image and generates the up-sampled 256 X 256 image.
